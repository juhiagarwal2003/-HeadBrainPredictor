## 🧪 Overview

With **HeadBrainPredictor**, we dive into the intriguing world of human anatomy! This project highlights:

- The power of calculating the slope and intercept of the regression line.
- Making predictions that unravel the mystery of brain weight.
- Evaluating our predictions using fantastic metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² Score.
- Stunning visualizations that showcase the relationship between head size and brain weight!

## 📊 Dataset

Our data comes from the insightful [Head Brain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jemishdonda/headbrain), which provides valuable information about head size and brain weight. We focus on two crucial columns:

- **Head Size (cm³)**: The predictor variable (independent).
- **Brain Weight (grams)**: The variable we want to predict (dependent).

## 🚀 Google Colab Setup

Getting started on Google Colab is as easy as pie! Just follow these steps:

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**:
   - Click on [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/) to create a new notebook or open an existing one.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   To work with the code and dataset, run the following code cell:
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/juhiagarwal2003/HeadBrainPredictor.git
   ```

3. **Install the Required Libraries**:
   Install any libraries you may need by running:
   ```python
   !pip install -r HeadBrainPredictor/requirements.txt
   ```

> Note: Ensure your dataset is uploaded to the Colab environment, or you can access it directly from Kaggle using pandas!

## 🎉 Usage

Once your environment is set up, you can dive into HeadBrainPredictor:

### 1. Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab

Run the cells in your Colab notebook to see the magic unfold. Follow the code provided in the `head_brain_predictor.py` script to predict brain weight based on head size.

## ✨ Implementation Details

Here’s how we work our magic:

1. Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. Calculate the coefficients (slope `b1` and intercept `b0`) that guide our predictions.
3. Make predictions for brain weight based on head size—no psychic powers needed!
4. Evaluate our spell’s effectiveness using RMSE and R² score.
5. Create stunning visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between head size and brain weight.

### 🔑 Key Functions

- `calculate_coefficients(X, Y)`: The secret formula to derive our slope and intercept.
- `predict(X, b0, b1)`: A function that predicts brain weight based on head size.
- `mean_squared_error(Y, Y_predicted)`: Measure how far off our predictions are!
- `root_mean_squared_error(Y, Y_predicted)`: The ultimate test for prediction accuracy!

## 🎨 Results

Our project generates stunning visuals that help us see the linear regression line against the original data points!

![Regression Line](https://github.com/juhiagarwal2003/-HeadBrainPredictor/blob/main/Regression__plot.png?raw=true)

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: `72.12`
- **R² Score**: `0.6393`
